		  So what does Lifetime Membership mean exactly? Besides, you know, membership for the rest of your life.\n\
		  Our intention for this group of golden-ticket winners is, first and foremost, to foster relationships. In the Lifetime Access crew, you\'re invited into a community built on collaboration and thought sharing, designed to not only improve the BNotes experience, but to add value to your lives by way of connecting with a group of creators like yourself.\n\
		  Here\'s a run down of all of the perks you signed up for:\n\
		  BNotes membership to support the entire lifespan of your business for one $100 investment.\n\
		  Access to a private Slack channel for Lifetime Members to connect, collaborate and contribute.\n\
		  Early app updates before we push them out to the rest of the world.\n\
		  Cheers to a lifetime of working smart, working hard, having fun and making better decisions. We\'re so glad you\'re along for the ride.\n\
		  Yours FOREVER,\n\
		  The BNotes Team'
